How to start and exit vi
What are the command and insert modes, and how to switch from one to the other
How to edit text
How to cut and paste lines
How to search forward and backward
How to undo

## REQUIREMENT

All tasks must be done inside the sandbox Ubuntu 20.04
Your sandbox must be available at the end of this project - the Checker will access to it just after the deadline to run the correction!
The answer of a task must be in a specific file
Each answer file must contain only the command to execute in Emacs for solving the task. Example: “What is the command to quit without saving changes?” -> the file should contain only :q!
